# Books Search App

This project was bootstrapped with https://github.com/RudeAnna/book-search.git

### How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

I have spent around 7 hours creating this app. If I had more time for this task I would create more components (bookPage, when opening each book), pagination, registration for users, so they could write comments and reviews, add books to bookmarks.

### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?

The most useful feature for me is the ability to handle local state with useState hook. It allows to use functional components instead of Class components.

### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I would use browser developer tools, performance tab in particular to record and assess the actions, unfortunately I do not have too much experience with it yet.

### How would you improve the API that you have just used?

I would make sure every book has a proper cover and those which do not should have a default cover image. Having a big isbn array slows the performance down and leads to a lot unnecessary requests. Not all the books have author name, publish year etc.
